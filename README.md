# 📰 News Personalizer
This app allows you to create a personal news feed by voting up your favorite news sources, and downvote ones you don't like.
Sources will be hidden after 5 downvotes.

All the data is stored locally in your browser. You can clear it with the button in the footer.

News stories are cached for five minutes, so don't expect instant results 😉
